# words-for-variables
A list of words and phrases to help name variables

When it comes to naming variables, functions of classes, I often find myself with the programmer's
equivalent of writer block. Over time, I've tried to write down useful words of phrases that have
worked for me in various contexts. Sometimes when I get stuck, scanning through the list can give
me a better variable name than what I'd come up with just by brainstorming.
